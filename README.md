# WindowsVolumeControls
AutoHotKey script that increases/decreases the volume of a Windows computer.

**Development State:**
Finished, optimized.

## Why I created this script ##
I created this AutoHotkey script because I had a similar feature by default on my Acer laptop keyboard and it was very annoying not having quick access to volume controls on the keyboard itself. I didn't want to buy a new keyboard with dedicated volume controls since I wanted a compact keyboard, so I created this AHK script. Enjoy!

## Installation Instructions ##
1. Download & Install AutoHotKey (https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2. Download the contents of this GitHub repo.
3. Right click on the VolumeControls.ahk file and choose the "Run Script" option to enable volume controls.
If you want this script to run at startup, see below.

## How To Run At Startup (Highly Recommended)##
If you want this script to run at the startup of your computer, there are many ways, but the easiest way is described below.
1. Right click on the VolumeControls.ahk file and click "Compile Script" to convert it to a .exe file.
2. Drag and drop the VolumeControls.exe file to the startup folder on your Windows machine.
(To go to startup folder, press "Windows Key + R" and enter "shell:startup")

## How To Use ##
Press "Windows Key + Up Arrow" to increase the volume.
Press "Windows Key + Down Arrow" to decrease the volume.
